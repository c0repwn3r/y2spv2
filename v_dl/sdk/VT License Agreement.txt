Visage Technologies License Agreement (VTLA) 
______________________________________________________________________________

SUMMARY

This introductory section summarizes the main conditions of the License Agreement with the sole 
purpose to enable easier reading. In case of ambiguity other sections prevail.

By installing Visage Technologies' software, you are agreeing to the terms of this Agreement. 
Visage Technologies grants you right to use its software internally for evaluation purposes. 
Furthermore, subject to separately agreed fees and other conditions stated in this Agreement and 
in the License Key File you may receive, you may develop and distribute your own product using 
Visage Technologies' software. Such products shall register themselves automatically with the 
Visage Technologies licensing server.
Software licensed under Academic and Evaluation licenses cannot be used for commercial 
purposes. If you have no valid License Key File, your license is an Evaluation license.
______________________________________________________________________________

DO NOT EDIT THIS AGREEMENT. It is a universal agreement covering evaluation, 
development and several common types of deployment licenses. If you require more specific 
licensing conditions, please discuss with Visage Technologies representative.

8. RETENTION OF RIGHT, TITLE AND INTEREST BY VISAGE TECHNOLOGIES. 
The Software shall at all times remain the property of Visage Technologies and/or Third Party 
Licensors and Licensee shall have no right, title, or interest therein, except as expressly set forth 
in this Agreement. 


9. LICENSES FOR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE. Visage Technologies has been granted 
licenses to distribute certain Third Party software by Third Party Licensors. As a condition of 
those licenses, Visage Technologies is required to distribute the Third Party software to Licensee 
subject to specific terms and conditions, which may be different from or additional to those 
contained herein for the Software. Licensee understands and agrees that acceptance of this 
Agreement also confirms Licensee's acceptance of the applicable provisions for use, including 
the restrictions on use, of such Third Party software. All such Third Party software and the 
corresponding licenses are listed in Schedule 3.


10. LICENSE TERM. 

10.1. License term is specified in the License Key File provided to the Licensee, either by expiry 
date or as "perpetual". If no License Key File has been provided to the Licensee, then the License 
term is one (1) month.

10.2. If the License term is specified in the License Key File as "perpetual", Licensee shall have 
the right to use the Software indefinitely, subject to the termination provisions in this Agreement. 

10.3. Licensee understands and agrees that the Software and Product will stop operating 
immediately after the expiration of License term specified in the License Key File, unless 
Licensee renews its License. 


11. TERMINATION. Visage Technologies may terminate this Agreement and all Licenses 
granted hereunder by written notice to Licensee if Licensee breaches any material term of this 
License, including failure to pay any License fees due, and Licensee has not cured such breach 
within thirty (30) days of written notification. Visage Technologies may immediately terminate 
upon notice this Agreement and all Licenses granted hereunder should Licensee breach the terms 
and conditions of Sections 4 and/or 5 of this Agreement. Licensee may terminate this License at 
any time, for any reason. Licensee shall not be entitled to any refund if this License is terminated. 
Upon termination, Licensee shall promptly return all but archival copies of the Software in 
Licensee's possession or control, or promptly provide written certification of their destruction.


12. TAXES, DUTIES, CUSTOMS. Absent appropriate exemption certificates or other 
conclusive proof of tax exempt status, Licensee shall pay all applicable sales, use, excise, value-
added, and other taxes, duties, levies, assessments, and governmental charges payable in 
connection with this Agreement or the Licenses granted hereunder, excluding taxes based on or 
measured by Visage Technologies' income or those based on or measured by the Third Party 
Licensors' income, for which Visage Technologies shall be solely responsible.


13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. The Software should not be relied on as the sole basis to 
solve a problem or implement a design whose incorrect solution or implementation could result 
in injury to person or property. If Software is employed in such a manner, it is at the Licensee's 
own risk and Visage Technologies and Third Party Licensors explicitly disclaim all liability for 
such misuse to the extent allowed by law. Visage Technologies' and Third Party Licensors' 
liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence or for any other matter in relation 
to which liability by law cannot be excluded or limited shall not be excluded or limited. Except as 
aforesaid, (a) any other liability of Visage Technologies and Third Party Licensors (whether in 
relation to breach of contract, negligence or otherwise) shall not in total exceed the amount paid 
to Visage Technologies under this Agreement in the twelve month period preceding the claim in 
question, for the Software with respect to which the liability in question arises; and (b) Visage 
Technologies and Third Party Licensors shall have no liability for any indirect or consequential 
loss (whether foreseeable or otherwise and including loss of profits, loss of business, loss of 
opportunity, and loss of use of any computer hardware or software). Some countries and states do 
not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above 
exclusion or limitation may not apply to Licensee.


14. LIMITED WARRANTY/LIMITATION OF REMEDIES. Visage Technologies warrants 
that Visage Technologies, on its own behalf or through Third Party Licensors, has the right to 
grant the License rights hereunder. Visage Technologies warrants, for a period of one (1) year 
from delivery or for the term of the License, whichever is less, that each copy of Software will 
conform in all material respects to the description of the Software's operation in its 
documentation. In the event that the Software does not operate as warranted, Licensee's exclusive 
remedy and Visage Technologies' sole liability under this warranty shall be the correction or 
workaround by Visage Technologies of major defects within a reasonable time. Should such 
correction or workaround be impractical, Visage Technologies may, at its option, terminate the 
relevant License and refund the initial License fee paid to Visage Technologies for Software. All 
requests for warranty assistance should be directed to Visage Technologies AB, Diskettgatan 11, 
SE-583 35 Linkoping, Sweden.


15. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. Except for warranties expressly set forth in Section 14 
of this Agreement (or as implied by law where the law provides that the particular terms implied 
cannot be excluded by contract), Software, its documentation and software maintenance services 
are delivered "as is" and Visage Technologies makes and the Licensee receives no additional 
express or implied warranties. Visage Technologies and Third Party Licensors hereby expressly 
disclaim any and all other conditions, warranties, or other terms of any kind or nature concerning 
the Software, its documentation, and software maintenance services (including, without 
limitation, any with regard to infringement, merchantability, quality, accuracy, or fitness for a 
particular purpose or Licensee's purpose). Visage Technologies also expressly disclaims any 
warranties that may be implied from usage of trade, course of dealing, or course of performance. 
Except for the express warranties stated in Section 14 of this Agreement, the Software, its 
documentation, and software maintenance services are provided with all faults, and the entire risk 
of satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy, and effort is with Licensee. Visage Technologies 
does not warrant that the Software will operate without interruption or be error free. Some states 
and countries do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above 
limitation may not apply to Licensee. The warranty in Section 14 gives Licensee specific legal 
rights and Licensee may also have other rights which vary from state to state and country to 
country. Licensee accepts responsibility for its use of the Software and the results obtained 
therefrom.


16. DISCLAIMER OF OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITY FOR LICENSEE'S PRODUCT. 

16.1. Visage Technologies shall have no support or warranty obligations, and disclaims all 
liability, for the Product developed or distributed by Licensee.

16.2. Licensee agrees that prior to using, incorporating, or distributing the Software in any 
Product, it will thoroughly test and validate the Product and the functionality of the Software in 
that Product and be solely responsible for any problems or failures.


17. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION. This Agreement shall be interpreted, enforced and 
construed and the rights of the parties hereunder governed in all respects by the laws of Sweden, 
and both parties consent to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Sweden and consent to the 
service of process, pleadings and notices in connection with any and all actions initiated in such 
courts. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be 
conclusive and binding and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction. To the extent any 
governing law, treaty, or regulation is in conflict with this Agreement, the conflicting terms of 
this Agreement shall be superseded only to the extent necessary by such law, treaty, or regulation. 
If any provision of this Agreement shall be otherwise unlawful, void, or otherwise unenforceable, 
that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible. In either case, the remainder 
of this Agreement shall not be affected. 


18. COMPLIANCE. Licensee agrees to notify Visage Technologies promptly upon discovery of any failure
to comply with one or more Licenses granted under this Agreement, or any failure to comply with any
other material term of this Agreement.


19. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, and any applicable Annex thereto including any 
documents referenced therein are incorporated herein by reference, and contain the entire 
understanding of the parties and may not be modified or amended except by written instrument, 
executed by authorized representatives of Visage Technologies and Licensee. In the event of any 
conflict between this Agreement and any purchase order executed by Licensee (whether executed 
before or after this Agreement), this Agreement shall prevail.
